## Code Scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artefacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running Unit Tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running End-to-End Tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
